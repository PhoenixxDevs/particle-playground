Just a litte mess around to see how I can mix my new css knowledge with my existing javascript knowledge.    

I may add more modes but I'm just testing the waters with Github and version control.   

There's plans to add a custom mode, inputting a configuration via html form and then running but I'm not sure when/if that will be implemented.

There are no touch events so the app won't work properly unless viewed on a pc
